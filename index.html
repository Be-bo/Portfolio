      What's ivy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ivy is a social networking app that digitizes the social experience of college and university. Our aim is to connect people on campus and
encourage real life interactions and campus engagement. There's plenty of events taking place on campus and there are so many interesting
people just within your department. And that's not even mentioning the fact that these people are of similar age with diverse interests!
We want ivy to be your one app for all things on campus. Imagine you wake up, add a few new people to chat with,
then you see that there's a free breakfast. Great, you head over there! After your classes there's a nice workshop on how to write a resume.
And finally, in the evening your favorite hot bbq wings are on special at the main pub on campus, so you take a few friends out...
All of these things in the palm of your hand, in ivy. No extra hassle, you don't need that extroverted social friend to tell you about everything that's going on.

    <h3>
      Features (implemented so far)
    </h3>
    <p>
      A networking app can't do without a chat feature but our primary feature is the "Quad" which is where you discover new people and get in touch with them.
It's a carousel that you can easily flip through in a playful way. You can only see the people on your campus (users are shown based on their university domain).
This is where you can see other people's major, interests and how well they're doing in terms of the "ivy GPA" which is the circular logo on the front of each card and it gains or loses leaves based on how active the user is.
Each user has their own gallery allowing for up to 5 images. To upload a picture a user has to go through a basic cropping feature to keep the proper aspect ratio for the Quad cards.
The 2 remaining tabs on the left are the Explore and the Board feature.
The Board allows students to see what other students are up to at the moment.
And the Explore feature will allow students to explore their campus.
It's important to note that the basic structure for the app is in place and it's working reasonably well at the moment but the app is still in development.
Its release is scheduled for September 2019 for both iOS and Android along with a web-based business portal for campus bodies and advertisers.
I'm the only developer working on ivy at the moment and am using it as a learning opportunity. All of the work related to ivy you can see here is mine.

  <div class="container-fluid text-container">
    <h3>
      Events in the palm of your hand
    </h3>
    <p>
      Even-U allows users to create events and associate keywords with them.
      Once an event is created other users can see it on the main dashboard in the app.
      All the events the user can see are sorted based on the user's interests/keywords which can be added in the profile section.
      At the top the user can see the most relevant events (Eg. When your interests are "party" and "drinking", all the party related events will likely be at the top - provided the hosts have associated these keywords with their events).
      So every user of the app sees the same events just in a different order.
      The events can also be searched manually using the search bar on the main dashboard (note that the manual search is not only based on the name of the event but the keywords, i.e. if I have an event called "Wild Night" with a keyword "party"
      searching for "party" will still display the event even though the word "party" is not in the event's name). Other Features include the ability to delete events one has created and commenting to communicate with other attendees as well as the
      host.
      <b>My Contributions</b> were mostly in the programming part of the app. I was responsible for the keyword matching, event sorting and searching.
      I was also responsible for the comment section and deleting events. As the most experienced Android developer on the team I also added some finishing touches on the UI to make the user experience that much smoother.
      This project was completed by a group of 3 students as the main project for a database course at the University of Calgary. The app was made in Android Studio.

  <div class="container-fluid text-container">
    <h3>
      Bringing 3-1-1 to the 21st century
    </h3>
    <p>
      We saw the current way of reporting problems in Calgary (or simply, in any city) as old and inefficient.
      You either have to download the city's app and go through a tedious list of descriptions providing all the necessary details or call 311 and spend several minutes on the phone.
      Obviously, no one has the will or the time to do all that not to mention steering your focus away from driving.
      This is where NotifyMi comes in, we combine the abilities of today's smartphones and simplicity of a great idea.
      Let's say you're driving on a busy road and suddenly you find yourself in a traffic jam. "Oh my god, there's a car crash slowing everything down!"
      You just have to say "Ok Google, Calgary Report." and state your problem. Other drivers with the app will immediately see the problem and will be able to avoid the road you're on.
      With the app you can see all the reported issues within your radius (currently set at 5km) and their respective distances updated in real time as you're driving. You can also tap the issue you're interested in which will open Google Maps and
      show you the report's precise location.
      This is also a great way for the city of Calgary to see the types of problems being reported, how often they're being reported and precisely where they are.
      This app was made by a group of 4 during the <b>Calgary Hacks 2019</b> hackathon. The idea was liked by the judges so much that <b>we placed first and won the hackaton</b>.
      We were also trying implement automatic push notifications and aggregated reports based on driver's route so that they're informed about any problems automatically without opening the app or just by asking the Google Assistant about what's
      going on on the road.
      Needless to say, the 24 hours constraint didn't allow us to finish these parts but we were getting close...
      <b>My contributions</b> were mostly in the app programming and design. I designed the app, implemented it and connected it to the Firebase Database which takes data from the Google Assistant. I also aided the effort to connect the Assistant to
      the Firebase.
      The app was made in Android Studio.

  <div class="container-fluid text-container">
    <h3>
      Calculating those weights without the numbers
    </h3>
    <p>
      FitnessTackler is the answer to all the complex and user unfriendly weightlifting fitness tracking apps.
      Our team had a bad experience with these and we wanted to create something that'd delight the user.
      We primarily strove to do that by removing the need to calculate any weight in the gym using images of the equipment.
      Now you're probably thinking: "Hang on a second, there's plenty of apps that use visuals of plates and barbells to add up the weight being lifted."
      Yes, you're right! But! From our experience these apps are almost always too complicated. They require an extra screen to do all that visual stuff.
      We wanted simplicity of the apps that don't use these visual elements and beauty of the ones that do.
      In the end our decision was to achieve this using two features: a visual keyboard that behaves just like your standard keyboard and collapsable items for workouts, exercises and sets so we can keep everything on one screen.
      Other features include calendar scheduling, workout templates and an exercise database so you don't have to type in everything yourself...
      This project was completed by 5 students for a Human Computer Interactions class at the University of Calgary.
      The app includes the basic features talked about above but only in so far as they are necessary for the UI to work properly. The user experience was after all the focus of the class.
      <b>My contributions</b> include the entire visual keyboard including the automatic weight calculation and the programming required to implement it. It was made using Xamarin in Visual Studio.
